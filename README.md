# TrinketEnderChest
A minecraft mod which uses fabric and the trinkets API to allow the player to wear an ender chest on the back slot to access it quickly.

<br/>

Requires Fabric and the [Trinkets API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trinkets-fabric).

 

This simple mod allows you to put an Ender Chest in your trinket back slot.

Then you can open it directly with a keybind (default: V).

 

 

This mod was inspired by the [Trinket Shulker Boxes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trinket-shulker-boxes-fabric) mod.
